# Preprocessing: preparing training and testing data


- Download BGL/HDFS_v1/Thunderbird dataset from [here](https://github.com/logpai/loghub). Download Liberty dataset
  from [here](http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/hpc4/liberty2.gz).
- For **BGL**, **Thunderbird** and **Liberty**, set the following variations in **sliding_window.py** under *
  *prepareData**
  directory:
   ```
   data_dir =  # i.e. r'/mnt/public/gw/SyslogData/BGL'
   log_name =  # i.e. 'BGL.log'
   ```

  For  **Liberty**, you should activate
  ```
  start_line = 40000000
  end_line = 45000000
  ```

  For  **Thunderbird**, you should activate
  ```
  start_line = 160000000
  end_line = 170000000
  ```

  Run ```python prepareData.sliding_window.py```  from the root directory to generate training and testing data.
  Training and testing data will be saved in {data_dir}.

- For **HDFS**, set the following directories in **session_window.py** under **prepareData**
  directory:
   ```
   data_dir =  # i.e. r'/mnt/public/gw/SyslogData/HDFS_v1'
   log_name =  # i.e. 'HDFS.log'
   ```
  Run ```python prepareData.session_window.py```  from the root directory to generate training and testing data.
  Training and testing data will be saved in {data_dir}
